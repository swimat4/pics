# Basic test plan

- clear all pics (can avoid this?)
- add pic A
- `pics co a`: should have A
- add pic B
- `pics co b`, `pics up a`: should have A & B and be equiv
- add pic C, replace pic B with D, rotate pic A (aka E)
- `pics co c`, `pics up a b`: should have C, D, & E
- del pic D
- `pics co d`, `pics up a b c`: should have C & E

TODO: A, B, C, D, E with taken date in EXIF
TODO: Test UTC vs. local time. How?
TODO: Test 'pics up' after a cancelled 'up' or 'co' works reliably.
