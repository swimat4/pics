- 'pics up --small 2006-12'
- start figuring out how the meta data should be editted
- 'pics edit' to add a tag to a pic (use a test pic, need write perm)
- 'pics diff'
- 'pics commit' (with edits)
- 'pics add' and 'pics commit' to add a pic and a set
- 'pics find': search substring in id, tags, title, desc, comments
- remote 'pics ls' in date dir
    pics ls flickr://trento/2007-01   # remote info


Long Term: auth handling
========================

- Fixup the auth steps
  (http://flickr.com/services/api/auth.howto.desktop.html) by either patching
  flickrapi.py or writing my own (possibly a fork).
  For now we just deal with the hack.
  
  
flickrapi.py
============

- fill in FlickrAPI as needed
- POST vs. GET (some require POST, some theoretically shouldn't be POST)
- auth_token caching? Use the same cache as the other flickrapi? Yes if
  reasonable. Make this caching optional.
- ElementFlickrAPI cogging:
    - nice doc strings
    - add pythondoc tags for args and exceptions
- note hidden API method:
