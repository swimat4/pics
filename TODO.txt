- 'pics ls' in date dir (to start getting the feel of flickrapi.py)
    pics ls 2007-01   # local co'd info
    pics ls flickr://trento/2007-01   # remote info
  therefore the 'co' needs to do more info
- 'pics open' (replaces 'go'), does a reasonable thing for the given path
    [~/pics/favs]$ pics open 1234
    [~/pics/favs]$ pics open Evan  # does a "close match" on title to determine which one
- 'pics up --small 2006-12'
- start figuring out how the meta data should be retrieved
- 'pics edit' to add a tag to a pic (use a test pic, need write perm)
- 'pics add' and 'pics commit' to add a pic and a set


Long Term: auth handling
========================

- Fixup the auth steps
  (http://flickr.com/services/api/auth.howto.desktop.html) by either patching
  flickrapi.py or writing my own (possibly a fork).
  For now we just deal with the hack.
  
  
flickrapi.py
============

- fill in FlickrAPI as needed
- POST vs. GET (some require POST, some theoretically shouldn't be POST)
- auth_token caching? Use the same cache as the other flickrapi? Yes if
  reasonable. Make this caching optional.
- ElementFlickrAPI cogging:
    - nice doc strings
    - add pythondoc tags for args and exceptions
- note hidden API method:
