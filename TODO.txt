- Do "Long Term: API rewrite" (as per START HERE in pics.py). See clipboard
  notes.
    - ElementFlickrAPI
        - cogging:
            - nice doc strings
            - add pythondoc tags for args and exceptions
        - nice Exceptions for errors: more cogging, share API data
    - auth_token caching? Use the same cache as the other flickrapi? Yes if
      reasonable. Make this caching optional.
    - DictFlickrAPI
        - nice type handling (booleans, ints, datetimes)
- more significant 'pics co'?
  - pics co --from 2006-09 --to 2006-12 ???
  - Perhaps default is to only get 100 most recent?
    WC stores the start_time, end_time sync'd. (Or could be list of ranges.
    YAGNI)
        $ pics co flickr://trento/ ~/pics
        A ~/pics/2006-09/1234.thumbnail.jpg
        A ~/pics/2006-09/1235.thumbnail.jpg
        A ~/pics/2007-01/1236.thumbnail.jpg
        Checked out latest 3 photos (<startdate>-<enddate>).
- 'pics ls' in 'favs' dir (to start getting the feel of flickrapi.py)
    pics ls favs   # local co'd info
    pics ls flickr://trento/favs   # remote info
  therefore the 'co' needs to do more info
- 'pics open' (replaces 'go'), does a reasonable thing for the given path
    [~/pics/favs]$ pics open 1234
    [~/pics/favs]$ pics open Evan  # does a "close match" on title to determine which one
- 'pics up --small 2006-12'
- start figuring out how the meta data should be retrieved
- 'pics edit' to add a tag to a pic (use a test pic, need write perm)
- 'pics add' and 'pics commit' to add a pic and a set


Long Term: auth handling
========================

- Fixup the auth steps
  (http://flickr.com/services/api/auth.howto.desktop.html) by either patching
  flickrapi.py or writing my own (possibly a fork).
  For now we just deal with the hack.
  
  
API rewrite
===========

- more natural argument and retval interpretation
- POST vs. GET (some require POST, some theoretically shouldn't be POST)
- note hidden API method:
