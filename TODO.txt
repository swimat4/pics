- basic 'pics setup'
- 'pics ls' in 'favs' dir (to start getting the feel of flickrapi.py)
- see how easy to write api using elementtree (borrowing heavily from
  flickrapi.py)
- 'pics open' (replaces 'go'), does a reasonable thing for the given path
    [~/pics/favs]$ pics open 1234
    [~/pics/favs]$ pics open Evan  # does a "close match" on title to determine which one
- 'pics up --small 2006-12'
- start figuring out how the meta data should be retrieved
- 'pics edit' to add a tag to a pic (use a test pic, need write perm)
- 'pics add' and 'pics commit' to add a pic and a set


Long Term: auth handling
========================

- Fixup the auth steps
  (http://flickr.com/services/api/auth.howto.desktop.html) by either patching
  flickrapi.py or writing my own (possibly a fork).
  For now we just deal with the hack.
